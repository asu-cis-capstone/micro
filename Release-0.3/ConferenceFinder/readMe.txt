1. The search engine is using the autocomplete feature. User type in any related characters will get the result on drop down menu.

2. This is only a demo website, the layout will be different after css work.

3. The map on right looks extremely small, which actually make directions even harder. Because of that, I will put mouse-over feature that once mouse move on the pic, it will shows the detailed image (zoom in) of the map (specific area).
